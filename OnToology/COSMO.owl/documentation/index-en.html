Includes representations of common concepts learned by children at an early age, plus              the most freqently used words of English..       Has representations of more than 6300 of the words most frequently               occurring in text corpora, with references to WordNet and               OpenCYC categories having the same meaning.    As of Rev1689: 20,726 owl:Classes                   19,654 distinct Single-word WordNet labels                   21,244 Single-word labels including also  en and ldoce labels not in WordNet                   18,642 distinct WordNet synsets linked (some appear more than once)  *** Current phase of development ***:        The Current phase is to add in 1720 words from an American Sign Language on-line          dictionary  not already  among the 'wordnet'. or 'en' tags, nor in          the openCYC nor BNC lists.       Finished adding in representations of about 1400 common words in OpenCYC                 not already represented in earlier versions at rev1623.       Finished adding in representations of the 6300 most frequent words in the BNC corpus         at rev 1577.        Brief history:        Effort at finding  the full set of semantic primitives started with           representation of the'defining vocabulary' of 2130 words in the           Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English.  (LDOCE).        The Longman-LDOCE vocabulary words and their WordNet mappings were          completed to end of 'Z' words (mapping completed) At rev1093. Started adding           WN labels to entries that have ID's the same as common words, but which          were not labeled (1600 of them at rev 1139) 20160423.  Finished 'Z' words.            Added additional 900 words in the vocabulary of a 6-year old (from 1903) at rev 1283            20171209         Has 19 top-level classes under 'Thing'      The representation of English words was expanded by adding in words from the 5000 most         frequent words in the BYU corpus, and words from the 6300 most frequent word         in the BNC corpus (that were not in the BYU list).  Finished at rev1577 20190729.   Protege 3.5 Metrics for rev1669  (20200330)     ca. 20427   OWL Classes , ca 65 of which are synonyms     ca.  1343   relations ('properties' not including 78 datatype)     Ca. 17211   restrictions     [ca.   284   metatypes (rfds:Class) ]          50497 'subclass' axioms        236 'disjoint' axioms         74 'Equivalent Classes' axioms         44 'Annotation Properties'       622 'SubObjectPropertyOf' axioms       341  'InverseObject Properties'       Uses elements of the OpenCyc OWL version 0.78, SUMO,          BFO and DOLCE ontologies, as well as elements created specifically for COSMO.         Added ontology elements corresponding to common English words (among the 5000 most         frequent in the BYU corpus).  Continuing with addition of representations of         other common English words from an American Sign Language dictionary..                   Parts of COSMO were closely aligned with elements of         other public ontologies such as OpenCyc, SUMO, and BFO,in order to ease the         translation of COSMO ontologies to those other structures, but the          conceptual structure of COSMO (hierarchy and relations) is too different from          those other ontologies to allow simplistic automatic translation; it is         anticipated that translation will be possible, but will require 'bridging         axioms' to convert the terms and syntax of COSMO to those of any other         ontology, and vice-versa.  The meanings of the COSMO elements must be interpreted          only from the structure of the COSMO ontology and from the full COSMO documentation.             **NOTE** According to the documentation of those other ontologies,          they are **freely usable** by the public, though they remain copyrighted          by their originators and appear to require only acknowledgment of their         use (more detail below).  No copyright restrictions are attached to          materials added in the COSMO project, therefore the only copyright         restrictions for use of this ontology are those placed by         the developers of the OpenCyc, SUMO, and BFO on parts derived         directly from those works.  Those derived parts will include some         of the labels, and parts of the documentation, but the hierarchy and relations         are those **specifically created** for COSMO, regardless of whether documentation         or names were adopted from other ontologies.  If necessary, the .         documentation text or names can be changed to avoid copyright issues.                  ******************   Source Materials  ****************************          *****  WordNet, OpenCYC, SUMO, Random House Webster  **************          *******************************************************************                   Relation of COSMO to other ontologies:             The COSMO ontology has a structure and basic viewpoint that         differs in some significant parts from that of the ontologies from which it          has derived materials, and the main parts of the hierarchical          structure and relations are not primarily derived from any of          the referenced ontologies, though some of the hierarchy is included because         of its use in WordNet. Most basically, the representations          were intended to adhere as closely as possible to **linguistic intuitions**         about the meaning and usage of English terms, while specifying         the meanings in a logically precise manner.  Every element added to COSMO         is individually evaluated for its utility and validity within the conceptual         structure of the COSMO ontology, and is not derived or adopted solely or         mainly on the basis of the appearance of a similar concept in another ontology.         Certain individual subtype relations are similar to those in OpenCyc or SUMO;         but because the basic hierarchical structure of COSMO differs from the         other ontologies, logical inference using these relations will arrive at         conclusions that cannot be aligned directly with either OpenCyc          or SUMO.  No simplistic mapping between COSMO and these other ontologies is likely to          enable accurate inference.  The documentation derived from OpenCyc and SUMO          is provided as a means to **reference** similar concepts in         those other ontologies, and to explain similarities and differences, for         the convenience of those who are familiar with those ontologies.         A few of the entres were included solely because of their presence in OpenCYC,         but these are usually specific to CYC and are icluded solely to permit alignment with         CYC concepts for those who are using the full CYC ontology. These are         not essential to the structure of the ontology and could be removed.
