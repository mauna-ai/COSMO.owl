abstract=COSMO ontology, Version 0.89-1705
          last edit 20200717 by Patrick Cassidy cassidy@micra.com

       Intended as an OWL-format ontology of primitive and common concepts suitable for use
          as an interlingua for semantic interoperability or language understanding.
       Includes representations of common concepts learned by children at an early age, plus
              the most freqently used words of English..
       Has representations of more than 6300 of the words most frequently 
              occurring in text corpora, with references to WordNet and 
              OpenCYC categories having the same meaning.

    As of Rev1689: 20,726 owl:Classes
                   19,654 distinct Single-word WordNet labels
                   21,244 Single-word labels including also  en and ldoce labels not in WordNet
                   18,642 distinct WordNet synsets linked (some appear more than once)

  *** Current phase of development ***: 
       The Current phase is to add in 1720 words from an American Sign Language on-line 
         dictionary  not already  among the 'wordnet'. or 'en' tags, nor in 
         the openCYC nor BNC lists.
       Finished adding in representations of about 1400 common words in OpenCYC 
                not already represented in earlier versions at rev1623.
       Finished adding in representations of the 6300 most frequent words in the BNC corpus
         at rev 1577.  

      Brief history:
        Effort at finding  the full set of semantic primitives started with 
          representation of the'defining vocabulary' of 2130 words in the 
          Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English.  (LDOCE).
        The Longman-LDOCE vocabulary words and their WordNet mappings were
          completed to end of 'Z' words (mapping completed) At rev1093. Started adding 
          WN labels to entries that have ID's the same as common words, but which
          were not labeled (1600 of them at rev 1139) 20160423.  Finished 'Z' words.  
          Added additional 900 words in the vocabulary of a 6-year old (from 1903) at rev 1283
            20171209
         Has 19 top-level classes under 'Thing'

      The representation of English words was expanded by adding in words from the 5000 most
         frequent words in the BYU corpus, and words from the 6300 most frequent word
         in the BNC corpus (that were not in the BYU list).  Finished at rev1577 20190729.

       Uses elements of the OpenCyc OWL version 0.78, SUMO, 
         BFO and DOLCE ontologies, as well as elements created specifically for COSMO.
         Added ontology elements corresponding to common English words (among the 5000 most
         frequent in the BYU corpus).  Continuing with addition of representations of
         other common English words from an American Sign Language dictionary..  
        
         Parts of COSMO were closely aligned with elements of
         other public ontologies such as OpenCyc, SUMO, and BFO,in order to ease the
         translation of COSMO ontologies to those other structures, but the 
         conceptual structure of COSMO (hierarchy and relations) is too different from 
         those other ontologies to allow simplistic automatic translation; it is
         anticipated that translation will be possible, but will require 'bridging
         axioms' to convert the terms and syntax of COSMO to those of any other
         ontology, and vice-versa.  The meanings of the COSMO elements must be interpreted 
         only from the structure of the COSMO ontology and from the full COSMO documentation.
             **NOTE** According to the documentation of those other ontologies, 
         they are **freely usable** by the public, though they remain copyrighted 
         by their originators and appear to require only acknowledgment of their
         use (more detail below).  No copyright restrictions are attached to 
         materials added in the COSMO project, therefore the only copyright
         restrictions for use of this ontology are those placed by
         the developers of the OpenCyc, SUMO, and BFO on parts derived
         directly from those works.  Those derived parts will include some
         of the labels, and parts of the documentation, but the hierarchy and relations
         are those **specifically created** for COSMO, regardless of whether documentation
         or names were adopted from other ontologies.  If necessary, the .
         documentation text or names can be changed to avoid copyright issues.

         Relation of COSMO to other ontologies:
             The COSMO ontology has a structure and basic viewpoint that
         differs in some significant parts from that of the ontologies from which it 
         has derived materials, and the main parts of the hierarchical 
         structure and relations are not primarily derived from any of 
         the referenced ontologies, though some of the hierarchy is included because
         of its use in WordNet. Most basically, the representations 
         were intended to adhere as closely as possible to **linguistic intuitions**
         about the meaning and usage of English terms, while specifying
         the meanings in a logically precise manner.  Every element added to COSMO
         is individually evaluated for its utility and validity within the conceptual
         structure of the COSMO ontology, and is not derived or adopted solely or
         mainly on the basis of the appearance of a similar concept in another ontology.
         Certain individual subtype relations are similar to those in OpenCyc or SUMO;
         but because the basic hierarchical structure of COSMO differs from the
         other ontologies, logical inference using these relations will arrive at
         conclusions that cannot be aligned directly with either OpenCyc 
         or SUMO.  No simplistic mapping between COSMO and these other ontologies is likely to 
         enable accurate inference.  The documentation derived from OpenCyc and SUMO 
         is provided as a means to **reference** similar concepts in
         those other ontologies, and to explain similarities and differences, for
         the convenience of those who are familiar with those ontologies.
         A few of the entres were included solely because of their presence in OpenCYC,
         but these are usually specific to CYC and are icluded solely to permit alignment with
         CYC concepts for those who are using the full CYC ontology. These are
         not essential to the structure of the ontology and could be removed.

         Most of the entries have annotation references to WordNet

         is WordNet 2.1 (see http://wordnet.princeton.edu/).
         Because the WordNet hierarchy differs in a number of places 
         from that of COSMO, these  pointers are only informative, and may not
         be useful for accurate  automatic conversion of WordNet sense tags (synsets) to 
         the corresponding senses in COSMO, but at least *part* of those WordNet word
         senses that are referenced will correspond to the intended meaning of the
         COSMO ontology element, and those words will, in some context, refer to 
         the intended COSMO sense.
